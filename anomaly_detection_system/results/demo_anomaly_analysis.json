The event does not appear to be anomalous as the energy and signal values are within the expected range for a background event. The high confidence in this classification is due to the clear separation of the S2/S1 ratio from the other event types."

The energy of 3.70 keV and the S1 and S2 signals are within the expected range for an Axion-like event, and the position and drift time are also consistent with a valid particle interaction. Therefore, this event is not considered anomalous, and I have a high degree of confidence in classifying it as Axion-like."

    "reasoning": "The event data falls into the 'Sterile-Neutrino' category as the S2/S1 ratio of 0.73 is below the 2.0 threshold for 'Axion-like' particles. However, the energy of 2.56 keV and the low S1 and S2 signals are unusual for a sterile neutrino detection, making this event anomalous. The confidence is high (0.8) as the event parameters are consistent with a sterile neutrino signature but deviate from typical sterile neutrino detection."

The event is considered anomalous due to the high S2/S1 ratio, which is indicative of an electronic recoil event, but does not fall into the typical background category. The high confidence is due to the clear match with the 'Novel-Anomaly' classification criteria."

Additionally, the energy of 24.24 keV is relatively high, and the S2 signal of 156.1 PE is also quite large, suggesting this event may be anomalous. Overall, the combination of the S2/S1 ratio and the unusual energy and signal characteristics indicate this is likely a novel, anomalous event worth further investigation."
