      "reasoning": "The event exhibits an exceptionally high S2/S1 ratio of 676.039109. This value is significantly greater than the threshold of 5, which unequivocally places it within the 'High S2/S1' band. Such a pronounced S2/S1 ratio is a definitive signature of an electronic recoil (ER) event, where the ionization yield (S2) is much higher relative to the prompt scintillation (S1) compared to nuclear recoils. This is characteristic of interactions from gamma rays or beta particles, which constitute the primary electronic recoil background in liquid xenon TPCs. The recoil energy of 2.710526 keV is consistent with a low-energy electronic recoil, and the event's position within the detector's active volume does not suggest any edge effects or anomalous localization.",
