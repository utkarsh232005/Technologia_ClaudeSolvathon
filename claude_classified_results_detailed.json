In a liquid xenon TPC, electronic recoils (ERs) typically produce a much larger ionization signal (S2) relative to their primary scintillation signal (S1) compared to nuclear recoils (NRs). This is due to the different energy deposition mechanisms and recombination probabilities for electrons and nuclei in the xenon medium. The observed ratio is a definitive signature of an ER event, consistent with common background sources such as gamma rays or beta decays. The recoil energy of 3.616821 keV is within a typical range for such events, and the position within the detector volume does not contradict this classification.",

This value is significantly greater than the threshold of 5, which unequivocally places it within the 'High S2/S1' band. Such a pronounced S2/S1 ratio is a definitive signature of an electronic recoil (ER) event, where the ionization yield (S2) is much higher relative to the prompt scintillation (S1) compared to nuclear recoils. This is characteristic of interactions from gamma rays or beta particles, which constitute the primary electronic recoil background in liquid xenon TPCs.

The recoil energy of 5.68 keV is consistent with various background sources, and the event's position within the detector's active volume does not contradict an ER classification.
